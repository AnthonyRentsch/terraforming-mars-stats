# Terraforming Mars Stats

This repository contains my work to create a dashboard with statistics from all of the games of [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) my roommates and I have played. We started playing and got **really** into it during the COVID-19 pandemic and played dozens and dozens of games dating back to spring of 2020.

To view the dashboard, which is deployed as a Heroku app visit https://terraforming-mars-stats.herokuapp.com/.

Hope you enjoy :slightly_smiling_face:
